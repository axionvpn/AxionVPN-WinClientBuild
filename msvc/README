OpenVPN project Microsoft Visual C buildsystem

About

    This subdirectory contains scripts for building OpenVPN
    and all it's dependencies using Microsoft Visual C.

    Note that this buildsystem is not actively maintained
    anymore, and people are strongly encouraged to use the
    cross-compile (mingw_w64) buildsystem instead. For
    details look here:

    ../generic/README
    ../windows-nsis/README

Usage

    If you're sure you _need_ to build using MSVC, please
    refer to instructions in the OpenVPN wiki:
